    * MANIFEST.SKIP: Added to ignore .git
    * t/01_Lingua-Translit-Tables.t: Added various tests to verify any
      supported transliteration can be referenced by a couple of variants
      of their names, i.e. "Common DEU", "common_deu", "COMMON DEU" or
      "common deu".
    * t/11_tr_Common_DEU.t: Added decoded UTF-8 input tests
    * Replaced HTML developer manual with a PDF version

0.15  -- 2009-10-19

    * Added support for the current development version of Perl (5.11) by
      using named Unicode properties instead of POSIX character classes
      within any context dependent transliteration rule.
      The following transliteration tables are affected:
        * xml/din_1460_bul.xml
        * xml/iso_9.xml
        * xml/streamlined_system_bul.xml
      Closes #50613. Thanks to Andreas Koenig for reporting this issue.
    * xml/template.xml: Added some more examples, added missing closing tag.
    * lib/Lingua/Translit/Tables.pm, xml/xml2dump.pl: To increase robustness
      and ease of use, tables are now associated with an identifier instead
      of their names.
    * Removed "utf8" and "bytes" pragmas.
    * Updated indent of all transliteration tables.

0.14  -- 2009-10-16

    * Added Win32 support. (Closes #49544)
      Please note that a Unix-like environment is still required to develop
      transliteration tables using the provided set of tools.
    * t/03_translit.t: Use $^X rather than relying on the shebang
    * Various trivial fixes, code cleanups and hyperlink updates
    * xml/manual/manual.pod: Added missing markup

0.13  -- 2008-04-29

    * Added developer manual covering the addition of own transliteration
      tables (xml/manual/).
    * Added test template (t/xx_tr_template.t.pl)
    * Makefile.PL:
        * Added "manual" target
        * Suited MSWin32 check for CPAN Testers tools

0.12 -- 2008-04-23

    * Added common Polish transliteration ("Common POL")

0.11 -- 2008-04-21

    * xml/din_1460_bul.xml: changed transliteration of SOFT SIGN to plain
      ASCII apostrophe.

        * Common SLK (Slovak)
        * Common SLV (Slovenian)

0.10 -- 2008-04-17

    * lib/Lingua/Translit.pm, xml/translit.dtd: Contexts can now contain two
      patterns at a time (before and after). These are combined using AND
      logics and therefore act as a logical "inbetween".
    * xml/xml2dump.pl: Switched from XML::Simple to XML::LibXML in order to
      prevent loss of whitespace charactes like U+180E.
    * xml/greeklish.xml: GREEK CAPITAL LETTER UPSILON WITH DIALYTIKA (U+03AB)
      bug fixed.
    * t/13_tr_Greeklish.t: Added test for upsilon bugfix.
    * Added two transliterations for Bulgarian:
        * DIN 1460

0.09 -- 2008-04-09

    * Added Mongolian transliteration "Common Classical MON". Thanks to
      Bayanzul Lodoysamba (baynaa@users.sourceforge.net) for contributing
      this table!
    * lib/Lingua/Translit.pm: "from" and "to" transliteration patterns are
      now evaluated literally only (within \Q and \E).
    * lib/Lingua/Translit/Tables.pm: Removed verbose package information from
      translit_list_supported()
    * translit: Display Lingua::Translit's version if show_list() is called
    * translit: For convenience, every underscore in a transliteration's name
      is substituted by a blank.
    * Makefile.PL: Exit with a hint on MSWin32 rather than dying in
      t/03_translit.t
    * xml/xml2dump.pl: workaround for discarded U+180E character (see l.85)
    * Added a transliteration table template (xml/template.xml)

    * Fixed a wrong codepoint in a DIN 31634 rule.

0.05 -- 2008-03-10

    * Renamed "DIN 5008" to "Common DEU" as the DIN norm doesn't cover the
      transliteration explicitly.

0.04 -- 2008-02-28

    * Added common Romanian transliteration ("Common RON")
    * Updated Makefile.PL to use tools/substitute_tables.pl to read a

      lib/Lingua/Translit/Tables.pm with it.

0.03 -- 2008-02-25

    * Added DIN 31634 (1982)
